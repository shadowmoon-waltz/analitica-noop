[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/shadowmoon-waltz/analitica-noop.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#shadowmoon-waltz/analitica-noop)

Modified version of [Analitica Library](https://github.com/federicoiosue/analitica) with only mock analytic helper.

Currently on a trackerless-app-build kick, as I don't use them often at the moment; that being said, I think they are useful and not an issue with opt-in/out.

# Analitica Library

![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/federicoiosue/analitica.svg)

## Overview

Usefull library to manage both Google Analytics and Piwik services to match FOSS software need

## Detailed overview

When developing an application, expecially if you're a single developer or small development team, is extremelly important to have informations about how to improve your work for users. Having analytics informations helps you to decide what language to translate your app into, if supporting RTL languages is relevant and many more things.

However, if you decide to work on a completelly open-sourced stack you can't simply include an arbitrary closed-source analytics library and go on. 
To simplify this task *Analitica* offers to developers an helper to manage both [Google Analytics](https://www.google.it/intl/it/analytics/) and [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) third-party libraries gaving you the opportunity to include just one of them or both managing dependencies in a Gradle-flavored way.

## How to include into your project

**Step 1.** Add the following snippet in your root *build.gradle* at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

**Step 2.** Add the needed dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
	{nonFossFlavor}Compile ('com.github.federicoiosue:analitica:{version}:googleAnalyticsRelease@aar'){
        transitive=true
    }
	{fossFlavor}Compile ('com.github.federicoiosue:analitica:{version}:piwikRelease@aar'){
        transitive=true
    }
    {nonFossFlavor}Compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:10.0.1'
    {fossFlavor}Compile 'org.piwik.sdk:piwik-sdk:1.0.2'
}
```

## Usage

### Instantiate helper

#### Piwik

```java

try {
	AnalyticsHelperanalyticsHelper = new AnalyticsHelperFactory().getAnalyticsHelper(context, true, PIWIK_URL, APPLICATION_ID);
  ...
} catch (AnalyticsInstantiationException | InvalidIdentifierException e) {
	...
}
```

#### Google Analytics

```java

try {
	AnalyticsHelperanalyticsHelper = new AnalyticsHelperFactory().getAnalyticsHelper(context, true, TRACKING_ID);
  ...
} catch (AnalyticsInstantiationException | InvalidIdentifierException e) {
	...
}
```

### Events tracking

```java
// Track view
analyticsHelper.trackScreenView("VIEW NAME");
// Track action
analyticsHelper.trackEvent(CATEGORY, "ACTION NAME");
```

### Mocked Helper

When analytics helper instantiation fail for any reason, or for development purposes when you don't want that any analytic data is sent a mock class is available.

```java
} catch (AnalyticsInstantiationException | InvalidIdentifierException e) {
	analyticsHelper = new MockAnalyticsHelper();
}
```

This class' methods simply do nothing but providing an implementation of the same interface than working *AnalyticsHelper classes.
